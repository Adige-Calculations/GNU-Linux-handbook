# Preface
-----------------------------------------------------------

This handbook contains documentation on using GNU/linux® systems, common workflows, and more as you dive deeper.
It is intended to support a medium-advanced  GNU/linux® user during the usage of the software.
It acts as a guide for doing some really neat things. However, keep in mind it should be
seen as a co-pilot for your workflow, instead of a place to study on, it is designed to be
used via keywords search.
