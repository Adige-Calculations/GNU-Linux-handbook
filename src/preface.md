# Preface
-----------------------------------------------------------

This handbook contains documentation on using GNU/Linux systems, common workflows, how
to get started and more as you dive deeper. It acts as a guide for doing some really
neat things. However, keep in mind it should be seen as a co-pilot for your workflow,
instead of a place to study on.

This handbook is intended to support a medium-advanced GNU/linuxÂ® user
during the usage of the software. It provides commands, explanations,
and extension that we find useful during our workflow here in Adige, and it is
designed to be used via keywords search. This allows you to enrich or
resolve a problem in the shortest possible time.
