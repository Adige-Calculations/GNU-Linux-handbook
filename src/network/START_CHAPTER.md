# Networking

There are various tools and commands available in Linux for managing and configuring network settings and connections.
Some common tasks related to networking on Linux include:

### Setting up network interfaces:  

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network interfaces are the physical or logical connections that allow a device to communicate with other devices on a network.
You can use the ```ifconfig``` or ```ip``` utility to view and configure network interfaces.

### Managing network connections:  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use the ```nmcli``` or ```nm-applet``` command to manage and create network connections in Linux. 
These commands allow you to configure the network settings for various types of connections, such as Ethernet, WiFi, and VPN.

### Viewing network statistics:  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can use the ```ip``` or ```netstat``` command to view network statistics, such as the number of packets sent and received,
the number of errors, and the status of network connections.

### Debugging network issues: 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you encounter any issues with your network connections, you can use the ```ping```, ```traceroute```, and ```mtr``` commands 
to troubleshoot the problem. These commands allow you to test the connectivity and performance of a network connection.


## Private IP Address

```192.168.0.0``` is the beginning of the private IP address range (that includes all IP addresses through ```192.168.255.255```)
assigned by .


One common IP address assigned to home routers is 192.168.1.1. This IP address is used because the router is on the
192.168.1.0 network. In the same way, routers on the 192.168.0.0 network are usually assigned the local, private IP address of 192.168.0.1.

To find out your private IP address, run:

```sh
ip route get 1.1.1.1 | awk '{print $7}'
```
If you are interested into visualize the private IP addresses of your network run:

```sh
nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24 
```

To returna panoramic of the system you want to investigate

```sh
nmap -sT -O <private_IP_address>   
```

> An address like 192.168.0.0 becomes unusable for any 
other purpose after it's established as a network number. If an administrator assigns 192.168.0.0 to any device on 
the network as a static IP address, the network stops functioning until that device is taken offline.

## Public IP address

A public IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to every device connected to the Internet. It allows devices to
communicate with each other and with servers over the Internet. Your public IP address is the address that is assigned to 
your device by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and is used to identify your device on the Internet. It is a unique 
identifier for your device, similar to your home address, and is used to route traffic to your device from other devices 
on the Internet.

You can find out your public IP address by using:
```ssh
curl ifconfig.co
```
The public IP address can change over time, especially if you have a dynamic IP address assignment from
your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If you have a dynamic IP address, it may change every time you connect
to the Internet or after a certain period of time. If you have a static IP address, it will remain the same 
unless you change it manually or through your ISP.

## Local IP address

```localhost``` is the default name of the computer you are working on. The term is a pseudo name for the
IP address```127.0.0.1```. This IP address allows the machine to connect to and communicate with itself.
Therefore, localhost (127.0.0.1) is used to establish an IP connection to the same device used by the end-user.

Although using ```127.0.0.1``` is the most common practice, the IPv4 network standard reserves the range 127.0.0.1
â€“ 127.255.255.255 for ```localhost```. Using another IP address within the range results in the same or similar manner.
 The IPv6 standard assigns one address to loopback - :: 1.
