# Package

<b>A package is a collection of files.</b> Then, a package manager takes care of its installation, with a 
well defined set of rules to place the files into the correct place within the system.

# Package manager

To understand the specific files and changes made by the ```apt``` package manager, you 
can use the ```dpkg``` command (debian packages only), which is the underlying package 
management tool that APT utilizes. The ```dpkg``` command allows you to query information 
about installed packages, including their files, configuration details, and more.

```sh
dpkg -L <package_name>
```
